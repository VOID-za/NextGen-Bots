        <br><br>
        <h4>On your bot page, you are not allowed to:</h4>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Include spam/junk, or completely irrelevant/nonsensical characters or phrases in your bot description or intentionally use up characters to reach the 250 character limit.</li>
          <li>Mention NSFW or include any NSFW content on the bot page (avatar or images).</li>
          <li>Show any media/content that may induce seizures (images, gifs, css).</li>
          <li>Using your page maliciously against users by either providing or linking to malicious content.</li>
          <li>Advertise any competitors (bot/server lists).</li>
          <li>Block any essential features, this includes buttons and advertisements.</li>
          <li>Use any of the provided buttons to link to unrelated content.</li>
          <li>List the incorrect prefix on your bot page.</li>
        </ol>
        </p><br>
        <h4>Bot rules and requirements:</h4>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Abide by NextGen Bots's Terms of Service, Discord's Terms of Service, API rate limits and Developer terms.
          </li>
          <li>Must be online during review, public and invitable.</li>
          <li>The main feature and majority of the commands must work.</li>
          <li>No NSFW content in any bot commands.</li>
          <li>May not include any seizure-inducing content (gifs, emojis).</li>
          <li>Commands must only require permissions that the command being run needs. (e.g the kick command can only require the kick
          permission as it's required to be used). Bots <b>cannot</b> require the administrator permission for it to work.</li>
          <li>Must not be an unmodified instance or fork of another bot and must have a considerable amount of modification.</li>
          <li>Must not be in competition with NextGen Bots.</li>
          <li>The term “loli” or any other term that refers to the sexualization of underage children cannot be used anywhere
          throughout your bot.</li>
          <li>Must not have the sole intent of impersonating other bots.</li>
          <li>Must not vote lock majority of your bot's commands. We encourage up to 3-5 votelocked commands to allow user
          flexibility.</li>
          <li>Your bot must keep all owner commands locked to developers (e.g evals, status/presence commands and any other commands
          that may present vulnerabilities with your bot).</li>
          <li>Multiple bots that are created using the same or very similar code/features should not be submitted individually.
          Instead, group them together in your main bot's help command or website page.</li>
          <li>Bots cannot ask for user login information (i.e. username/password/token) for any site or service. This does not include
          API authentication tokens, only user login tokens.</li>
        </ol>
